A series of exhibition simulations from my thesis which develop a number of different numerical schemes (ie. RK4, fourier pseudo-spectral, predictor-corrector schemes etc.)
using a series of different coding methods. The ultimate aim was to compare the predictive power and applicability of numerous schemes of a modified Boussinesq field as model
for electro-mechanical pulse propagation of the action potential in biomembranes. In doing so, the model can elucidate more about human sensory experience, aenesthetic action,
deep network modelling and insights in to a number of other fields. It is likely that nature has found a way of exploiting some of the solitonic properties displayed herein as 
physiologically expeditious tools somewhere along its evolutionary path.
